# Project Overview
We are going to make a webbsite where you will be able to book a haircut. The sight will start on a starting page where you will be able to choose either to book a haircut or find a contact list. If you choose the booking button you will be redirected to another page where you will be able to choose what kind of haircut you want. After that you will be guided to a calender where you can choose a date and a time for your haircut.
